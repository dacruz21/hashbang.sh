## Internet

So the internet is kind of a big deal. But how do email clients, web browsers,
and chat programs actually work?

In this chapter we will explore the fundamental protocols that power the
internet through examples of how to interact with them in "raw" format.

An internet protocol is basically a chat room where every participant speaks
a particular shorthand according to a predefined set of rules to make things
efficient.

In 1969 a program called "telnet" was developed by the Internet Engineering
Task Force as a kind of universal program to communicate with the various
internet protocols.

Back in those days you would "dial in" to connect to a particular computer,
such as that of a university. You could then, if you were familiar with
the needed protocols, type special messages to the server in telnet, and the
server would give you responses, or take actions on our behalf.

These early protocols were not particularly efficient as they were designed
for -humans- to type commands by hand, so they needed to be somewhat memorable.

At this time the internet was nothing but a bunch of text based terminals
linked together at a distance. Some of these computers would relay email,
some would act as document libraries, and some would provide message boards,
chat rooms, or online games.

Since the authors of these early protocols spoke english, the protocol itself
was made up almost entirely of various shorthands for english words, much like
most programming languages.

With the rise of graphical user interfaces, the terminals all got hidden away
and programs were written so that button presses could cause a program
to send remote computers these various english-ish words for us.

The internet we know today, as a result is mostly just pointing, clicking,
dragging and dropping... that is interpreted into english-ish language,
which is then sent to remote computers that translate that english-ish language
into various machine code needed to get information or perform actions for us.
The computer then translates responses back from machine code back to
english-ish language designed for humans, which our computers interpret back
into visual graphical user interfaces we can once again drag, drop, point, and
click.

It all really is as crude and ridiculous as it sounds. We engineers really do
have no idea what we are doing and mostly just make it all up as we go, only to
realize years later everything we did was wrong. It is really pretty incredible
the internet works at all.

The rest of this chapter will focus on getting back to the 70s and interacting
with todays real internet services using only very basic english-ish human/text
interfaces like telnet that these protocols were -actually- designed for.

In doing so we will peek under the hood of the internet.
