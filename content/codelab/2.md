$title: Initializing a new Grow project
$category: Codelab
$order: 2

To start your first Grow project, the easiest thing to do is to use the `grow init` command. This command fetches a *theme* (which is like a scaffold) and clones it to your computer, ready for you to develop upon. Themes are Git repositories. They are just Grow projects with some special theme-related data.

But wait! You mentioned that Grow is all about configuration, not code, and now we're downloading scaffolding? Grow's default themes are primarily *configuration scaffolds*. When you run `grow init`, Grow creates a set of all the basic required config files. *Pods require you to implement absolutely zero business logic code*; Grow uses the config files to determine your web site's entire architecture.

Run the following command:

```bash
# Clones the "codelab" default theme to a directory "my-codelab" in the current directory.
$ grow init codelab ./my-codelab/
$ cd my-codelab/
```

You'll now have the "codelab" theme on your computer, ready to use with Grow. To understand what we mean by "configuration, not code," let's take a look at the structure of a Grow project.

## Install dependencies

When first starting work with a grow site it is a good practice to run the install command to install and setup any dependencies for the project.

```bash
# Installs any dependencies such as node packages and extensions.
$ grow install
```

## Pod structure

Grow projects (which we call *pods*) contain everything that Grow needs to build your site: content, structure, translations, static files, templates, etc. Again, you won't have to write any code to determine how your site is served or its architecture â€“ configs take care of that for you. Because of this concept, if you need to change URLs later, or add or remove localizations (for example), it's simply a matter of changing the configs within your pod.

Let's now take a look at the structure of a pod. This is the "codelab" pod that was cloned to your computer.

```text
/content/       # Content collections, blueprints, and documents.
/source/        # Source files for asset/media/JS/CSS generation.
/translations/  # Content and UI string translations.
/views/         # Frontend templates.
/podspec.yaml   # Pod specification file.
```
